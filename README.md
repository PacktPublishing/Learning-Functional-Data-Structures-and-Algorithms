#Learning Functional Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the code repository for [Learning Functional Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-functional-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785888731), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is about functional algorithms and data structures. Algorithms and data structures are fundamentals of computer programming.

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
user=> (def v [7 11 19 52 42 72]) 
#'user/v 
user=> (def v1 (conj v 52)) 
#'user/v1 
```

You need to install Scala and Clojure. All the examples were tested with Scala version 2.11.7.  The Clojure examples were tested with Clojure version 1.6.0. You don’t need any IDE as most of the examples are small enough, so you can key them in the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop).

You also need a text editor. Use whichever you are comfortable with.
