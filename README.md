#Learning Functional Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the code repository for [Learning Functional Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-functional-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785888731), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is about functional algorithms and data structures. Algorithms and data structures are fundamentals of computer programming.

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
user=> (def v [7 11 19 52 42 72]) 
#'user/v 
user=> (def v1 (conj v 52)) 
#'user/v1 
```

You need to install Scala and Clojure. All the examples were tested with Scala version 2.11.7.  The Clojure examples were tested with Clojure version 1.6.0. You donâ€™t need any IDE as most of the examples are small enough, so you can key them in the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop).

You also need a text editor. Use whichever you are comfortable with.
